# Fabulinus - The Practical Language Reference

The success of numerous programming ecosystems and open source projects means that developers are very often thrown into 
understanding, repairing, and extending code in a variety of languages.  Most of what's needed to get things done falls 
into a small number of categories, all of which can be captured concisely through working examples.

This project aims to provide those examples quickly and clearly.  It's a bit like a structured version of Learn X in Y Minutes.
